# NPC_generator
Just another random NPC generator - This time in excel.

This is just a simple excel file for generating random NPCs. It is not refined, beautiful or particularly well-coded. In fact it's the opposite. But it was done quickly and it works for my own personal usage with all the imperfections it has.

**Fair Warning: Do not think this will work for you.** It might, but the intended audience is just me. So I'm only sharing it because I figured others might find it useful. It comes with zero guarantees of future updates, bug correction or any improvements.

The basic is a few sheets displaying a random NPC; both completely random and a few specific classes or races. I might add more if I find the need. I might not.

**Important functionality instruction 1: Calculation should be set to "Manual"** the workbook is meant to be used in Excel with the auto-calculation off! This can be set to on or off under options and calculation options. If it's set to automatical, the NPCs will re-roll every time you do anything in the workbook. Just be aware that this is a global setting in Excel, meaning that ALL your excel files will calculate manually while this is set.

**Important functionality instruction 2:The workbook uses a macro** Since auto-calculation is meant to be turned off, there's a button that when clicked re-rolls the NPC, but only the active NPC. Not the other sheets. However, this is a macro, so for it to work you need to enable macros. If you do not feel comfortable doing that, you can use the "Calculate Sheet" function under the "Formula" ribbon. However, this will not take into account the plot hook. The plot hook is based on a calculation on the data sheet that is also triggered by re-rolling an NPC. So you'll have to either calculate the entire workbook, or calculate both the NPC sheet and the data sheet to re-roll a plot hook.

**Content source:** The content of the tables have been pulled from various open sources around the internet. Here's a list of links to the ones I remember. Should you find your content here, and your credit not mentioned, DM me and I'll make sure to give you the right credit.
